# attiny85_dev_board

This is a small prototyping board for ATTiny 25/45/85 microcontrollers. It has LEDs and buttons for the PB 0-4 outputs, plus reset button. The buttons are current limited, so that if the user switches a pin to output, then sets it high then presses a button to pull to ground, it will not damage the pin. Also added lots of GND, VCC and 3.3V connections from the onboard regulator.
